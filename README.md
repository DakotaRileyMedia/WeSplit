# WeSplit
 WeSplit was completed as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI course from Hacking with Swift. It is the first project I completed after learning the basics of Swift. The app is a restraunt check splitting app, where you input the bill tip percentage, and number of people you wish to split the bill with and it then calculates the amount and displays it for you.
